# BigToDo

## Description

// initial commit for grading

What's the big problem with To Do lists? They're overwhelming! To get through everything on your list,
you need a personal assistant. How can your personal assistant help you?

### What mode am I in?

When dealing with To Dos, you are either:
 - Capturing
 - Planning
 - Doing

When you are CAPTURING, you want to note what needs to be done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
You don't want to get bogged down organizing items - you can do that later when you're at the coffee shop
or sitting on your patio having a glass of wine.

When you are PLANNING, you want to look at tasks associated with a given **Project**. That way you can think
through the sequence and relationships between the related actions that move your project along.

When you are DOING, you want to know what tasks you can do given your current **Context**. This can be a physical
location like *At Home* or a virtual location like *On Internet* or *Phone*.

### Capturing mode

This is the default mode on login. The only two available actions are *Add Task* and *Add Project*. Each brings up
a form allowing you to add a task or project respectively, and provides "Save" and "Cancel" buttons that return you
to the first screen (after saving and clearing the form with "Save", only clearing the form with "Cancel").

### Planning mode

In this display, you can select a project from a selection box, beginning at the top level. The left hand side display
will show the tasks associated with that project (at that level) and the right hand side will show subprojects (children
projects) of that project. Clicking on one of the subprojects will re-do the display with that subproject now at the top level.

### Doing mode

In this mode, you select a context from the drop-down selector, and get a list of tasks that are associated with / tagged with 
that context. For example: "I'm at home; show me all the tasks I can be working on while I'm at home" (regardless of what project
they're associated with).

### Inbox clearing (organizing) mode

This mode is where you take the tasks you've captured and assign them to projects and contexts.
