# BigToDo

## Description

What's the big problem with To Do lists? They're overwhelming! To get through everything on your list,
you need a personal assistant. How can your personal assistant help you?

### What mode am I in?

When dealing with To Dos, you are either:
 - Capturing
 - Planning
 - Doing

When you are CAPTURING, you want to note what needs to be done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
You don't want to get bogged down organizing items - you can do that later when you're at the coffee shop
or sitting on your patio having a glass of wine.

When you are PLANNING, you want to look at tasks associated with a given **Project**. That way you can think
through the sequence and relationships between the related actions that move your project along.

When you are DOING, you want to know what tasks you can do given your current **Context**. This can be a physical
location like //At Home// or a virtual location like //On Internet// or //Phone//.
